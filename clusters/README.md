# Clusters
For clusters create a directory and place the cluster deploy and install-configurations into specific directories. For example it may look like the following when you do an ls.

```
ls git/tekton-argocd/clusters/
east1  east1-4xlarge-workers  east2  east2-44  README.md  west1  west2  west2-4xlarge-workers
```

```
ls git/tekton-argocd/clusters/east1
east1-cluster-deploy.yaml  east1-install-config.yaml
```
